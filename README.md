## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing App automation testing with Appium, you would need to follow these steps:

- Download and install **NodeJS**. You should be having **NodeJS v6** or newer. Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download.
- Make sure you are using the latest version of **JavaScript**.
- Install **npm** from the official website by clicking [here](https://www.npmjs.com/).

### Clone The Sample Project

Clone the TestMu AI’s :link: [LT-appium-nodejs-mocha](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-nodejs-mocha) repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-nodejs-mocha
cd LT-appium-nodejs-mocha
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your TestMu AI credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-nodejs-mocha) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-nodejs-mocha).

Set TestMu AI `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

**For Linux/macOS:**

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME \
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```

**For Windows:**

```powershell
set LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME `
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```

### Upload Your Application

Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the TestMu AI servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

**Using App File:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

```bash
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"'
```

**For Windows:**

```powershell
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk""
```

**Using App URL:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

```bash
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"'
```

**For Windows:**

```powershell
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -d "{"url":"https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk","name":"sample.apk"}"
```

> **Tip:**

> - If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on TestMu AI by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
> - Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.

## Run Your First Test

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first test on LambdaTest.

Test Scenario: Check out [android_test.js](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-nodejs-mocha/blob/master/specs/android_test.js) file to view the sample test script for android and [ios_test.js](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-nodejs-mocha/blob/master/specs/ios_test.js) for iOS.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

You can update your custom capabilities in the scripts. In our sample script, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code for a single test are defined as:

**Android:**

```javascript title="android.conf.js"
exports.capabilities = {
  'build': 'Mocha-Appium-Sample', //Build name
  'name': 'Mocha-Android', // Test name
  'platformName':'android', // OS name
  'deviceName': 'Galaxy S10', // Device name
  'platformVersion': '11', // OS version
  'app' : 'lt://proverbial-android',     // Add app (.apk) url here
  'isRealMobile' : true,
  'visual': false,  // To take step by step screenshot
  'network':false,  // To capture network Logs
  'console':false, // To capture console logs.
  'tunnel': false // If you want to run the localhost than change it to true
  };
```
**iOS:**

```javascript title="ios.conf.js"
exports.capabilities = {
  'build': 'Mocha-iOS-Sample', //Build name
  'name': 'Mocha-iOS', // Test name
  'platformName':'ios', // OS name
  'deviceName': 'iPhone 12 Pro', // Device name
  'platformVersion': '15', // OS version
  'app' : 'lt://proverbial-ios',     // Add app (.ipa) url here
  'isRealMobile' : true,
  'visual': false,  // To take step by step screenshot
  'network':false,  // To capture network Logs
  'console':false, // To capture console logs.
  'tunnel': false // If you want to run the localhost than change it to true
  };
```

**Info Note:**

- You must add the generated **APP_URL** to the `"app"` capability in the config file.
- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt :link: **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.testmuai.com/capabilities-generator/index.html)**. A more Detailed Capability Guide is available [here :page_facing_up:](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/) .

## Executing The Tests

Installing depencies:

```js
npm i
npm install
npm install selenium-webdriver
npm i appium-android-driver
npm i appium-base-driver
npm install --save
```

Execute the following command to run your test on TestMu AI platform:

**Android:**

```js 
npm run android    //to run single test
npm run parallel_android    //to run parallel tests
```

**IOS:**

## 🚀 LambdaTest is Now TestMu AI

👋 Welcome to TestMu AI, the next evolution of LambdaTest. As of January 2026, [LambdaTest is Now TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/lambdatest-is-now-testmuai/) - we have evolved from a cross-browser testing cloud into a unified, AI-native quality engineering platform designed for the modern DevOps era.

Whether you have been part of the LambdaTest community for years or are just discovering TestMu AI, our mission remains the same: to help you ship faster with high-scale test execution, autonomous testing, and deep quality analytics.

### 🔄 Our Rebrand Journey

In 2017, we introduced LambdaTest with a clear mission: to become the world's most trusted cloud testing platform. We built a scalable, high-performance test cloud that eliminated flakiness, improved developer feedback cycles, and accelerated release velocity for teams worldwide.

As LambdaTest grew, we expanded the platform into Test Intelligence, Visual Regression Testing, Accessibility Testing, API Testing, and Performance Testing, covering the entire testing lifecycle. These capabilities enabled teams to test any stack, on any technology, at enterprise scale.

Over time, we rebuilt the architecture to be AI-native from the ground up. What began as LambdaTest's high-performance testing cloud has now evolved into TestMu AI, an AI-native, multi-agent platform redefining modern quality engineering.

We chose the name TestMu AI to reflect our shift towards intelligent, autonomous testing. While our identity has changed, our core technology and commitment to the testing community stay the same.
